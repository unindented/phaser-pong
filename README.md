Simple game built with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/).

You can control the paddles with the keyboard (`A/W` and `O/L`), or with your fingers on touch-enabled devices.


## Install

If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.com/) installed on your system, just run:

```sh
$ npm install
```


## Build

You can also serve the game assets while watching for changes and rebuilding automatically:
